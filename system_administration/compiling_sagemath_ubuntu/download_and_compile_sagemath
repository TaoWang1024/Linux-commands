# select a mirror, download the torrent file for the tarred and gzipped most current version of SageMath
# (currently, sage-9.7.tar.gz)
https://www.sagemath.org/download-source.html

# (i always go with the mit archives.)
# choosing the torrent option in firefox will launch ubuntu's built-in torrent client, called transmission.
# once the download has completed, make sure to close transmission and delete the torrent file.

# gunzip and untar file
gunzip sage-9.7.tar.gz

# set the location of compiled sagemath in the hidden directory .local in our home directory
SAGE_ROOT="$HOME/.local/sagemath"
# cd into the sage-9.7 directory
cd sage-9.7/

make -j 4 # allow make to use 4 cores for the compile process
# SageMath is an integrated collection of open source software, all of which gets compiled
# this means that it takes time for compile to run to completion (95 minutes for me on my vm)

# i have experienced memory exhaustion during the make step.
# when this happens, the system's oomd (out-of-memory daemon) kills the process(es) responsible
# for the exhaustion, meaning the compile process halts before completing normally.
# if you need to re-run the compile process, delete the build directory (in this case, the sage-9.7 directory),
# and re-untar the tar file.

# to deal with the memory exhaustion problem, you can either temporarily increase the vm's memory
# to compile sagemath (turn the vm off, go to settings for the vm in the hypervisor; and increase
# the vm's ram by at least one more GB), or run the compile with fewer cores.
# (increasing ram can shorten how long it takes sagemath to compile. for me, it was ~80 minutes.
# decreasing the core count can lengthen how long it takes sagemath to compile.)

# assuming that you've compiled and installed python and sagemath into .local
# following the instructions i've provided, you'll want to add these lines to the top
# of your .bashrc file:
alias python=python3
alias pip=pip3
PATH="/home/user/.local/bin:$PATH:/home/user/.local/sagemath/bin"

# restart your bash session and test to ensure everything works
# (invoke python on the command line; make sure it's the compiled version.
#  invoke sagemath on the command line)
