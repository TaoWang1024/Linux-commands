# SageMath is an integrated collection of open source software, all of which gets compiled
# this means that it takes time for compile to run to completion (95 minutes for me on my vm)

# assuming that you've compiled and installed python and sagemath into .local
# following the instructions i've provided, you'll want to add these lines to the top
# of your .bashrc file:
alias python=python3
alias pip=pip3
PATH="/home/user/.local/bin:$PATH:/home/user/.local/sagemath/bin"

# restart your bash session and test to ensure everything works
# (invoke python on the command line; make sure it's the compiled version.
#  invoke sagemath on the command line)
