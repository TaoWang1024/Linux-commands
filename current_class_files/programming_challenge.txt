1) specification: create a new function that, given an array of ints or floats (not exclusive-or --- in other words, the array can include both ints and floats), returns two LoTs, one that holds the index/value pairs of all the smallest values in the array, and one that holds the index/value pairs of all the largest values in the array.
after testing your function to make sure it works, pass in the array of nucleotide string lengths from our reformatted fasta file; and find out how many records with smallest lengths of 200 nucleotides there are, and how many with largest lengths there are.
email me your answer.

2) specification: given the formula for getting percent gc content, find out how many smallest and greatest percent gc content values map to smallest lengths of 200 nucleotides.

3) specification: write a function that can act as a garbage filter in the get_min_max() function. in other words, write a function that ensures that input is either a list or tuple of ints or floats.
