"Besides merely being a finite set of rules which gives a sequence of operations for solving a specific type of problem, an algorithm has five important features:

"1) Finiteness. An algorithm must always terminate after a finite number of steps
"2) Definiteness. Each step of an algorithm must be precisely defined; the actions to be carried out must be rigorously and unambiguously specified for each case.
"3) Input. An algorithm has zero or more inputs, i.e., quantities which are given to it initially before the algorithm begins.
"4) Output. An algorithm has one or more outputs, i.e., quantities which have a specified relation to the inputs.
"5) Effectiveness. An algorithm is also generally expected to be effective. This means that all the operations to be performed in the algorithm must be sufficiently basic that they can in principle be done exactly and in a finite length of time by a man using pencil and paper."
